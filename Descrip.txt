RR3D: Displays a rotatable and scaleable wire frame of any
3D mathematical function.  This can be made up from the 
normal VB maths plus inverse and hyperbolic functions.
Functions can be created and saved as wanted.  Image vertices
can also be saved for use elsewhere.  
The MS ScriptControl Eval function simplifies calculations
enormously and its use is demonstrated.  Also shown are
MoveToEx, LineTo  which are much faster than the VB 
equivalents and very easy to use.  Included are a set of string 
handling subroutines such as count characters, squeeze out 
spaces, replace sub-strings etc.  Commented throughout 
including the 3D maths and perspective methods.  All the 
files are visible and the program is written for an 800x600 
screen.
