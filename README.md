## RR3D


</div>

### Description

RR3D: Displays a rotatable and scaleable wire frame of any

3D mathematical function. This can be made up from the

normal VB maths plus inverse and hyperbolic functions.

Functions can be created and saved as wanted. Image vertices

can also be saved for use elsewhere.

The MS ScriptControl Eval function simplifies calculations

enormously and its use is demonstrated. Also shown are

MoveToEx, LineTo which are much faster than the VB

equivalents and very easy to use. Included are a set of string

handling subroutines such as count characters, squeeze out

spaces, replace sub-strings etc. Commented throughout

including the 3D maths and perspective methods. All the

files are visible and the program is written for an 800x600

screen.
